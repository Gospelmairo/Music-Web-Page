# Music WebPage 

This is a music webpage that allows you to play and pause a song using a music icon. The webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To run the music webpage, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The webpage will load and display a music icon.

Clicking the music icon will toggle between play and pause functionality. When the song is playing, the icon will represent the pause button, and when the song is paused, the icon will represent the play button.

## Customization
Feel free to customize the webpage to suit your preferences. You can modify the following files:

index.html: Update the content, layout, or structure of the webpage.
styles.css: Modify the CSS styles to change the appearance of the music icon or any other elements on the page.
script.js: Adjust the JavaScript code to modify the play/pause functionality or add additional features.
